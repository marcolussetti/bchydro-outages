This project was ~~inspired by~~ copied from [Simon Willison's project tracking Californian Fires](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/). Simon has a good writeup on how he built that project on [his blog](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/) and there is a broader discussion of the topic on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24732943) if you want more background.
